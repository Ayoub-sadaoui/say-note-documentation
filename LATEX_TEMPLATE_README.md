## Special Features

### Academic Cover Page

The template includes a university-style cover page modeled after the format used by Université M'hamed Bougara - Boumerdès for academic theses. This cover page includes:

- University header and logo
- Department and academic information
- Project title in a framed box
- Author and supervisor information
- Jury members and defense date

For detailed instructions on customizing the cover page, see `UNIVERSITY_COVER_README.md`.

### Detailed Table of Contents

The template features a comprehensive, multi-level table of contents similar to academic theses, with:

- Chapter-level entries with page numbers
- Section and subsection entries with proper indentation
- Subsubsection entries for detailed organization
- Automatic page numbering and reference updating

The structure is defined in `voicenotion_toc_structure.tex`, which you can modify to match your specific documentation needs.

## Prerequisites

To compile the LaTeX document, you need to have the following installed:

1. A TeX distribution:

   - [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (Linux/Windows)
   - [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) (macOS)
   - [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) (Windows)

2. Required LaTeX packages (typically included in standard distributions):

   - graphicx
   - xcolor
   - hyperref
   - tcolorbox
   - listings
   - fancyhdr
   - tikz
   - longtable
   - booktabs
   - geometry
   - titlesec
   - float
   - array
   - tocbibind
   - tocloft

3. Optional: ImageMagick (for automatic creation of placeholder university logo)

## How to Compile

### Using the Makefile

The easiest way to compile the document is using the provided Makefile:

```bash
# Create the output directory and compile the PDF
make

# Create a placeholder university logo if needed
make placeholder

# View the compiled PDF (if supported on your system)
make view

# Clean up auxiliary files (keeping the PDF)
make clean

# Remove all generated files including the PDF
make distclean

# Show help information
make help
```

### Manual Compilation

If you prefer to compile manually:

```bash
# Create output directory
mkdir -p output

# Compile the document (run multiple times for references)
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -output-directory=output voicenotion_template.tex
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -output-directory=output voicenotion_template.tex
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -output-directory=output voicenotion_template.tex
```

## Customizing the Template

### Adding Your Content

1. Edit `voicenotion_template.tex` to replace placeholder content with your actual content.
2. Modify `voicenotion_toc_structure.tex` to match your specific document structure.
3. Update or add sections as needed to match your documentation requirements.
4. Replace placeholder images with actual screenshots and diagrams.
5. Customize the cover page with your project details and university information.

### Creating Detailed Content

For each major section of the document, you can create separate .tex files (similar to `voicenotion_introduction.tex`):

1. Create a file for each chapter (e.g., `voicenotion_chapter1.tex`)
2. Add your content using the proper LaTeX formatting
3. Include these files in the main template using `\input{filename}`

### Modifying the Appearance

- Colors: The template defines VoiceNotion brand colors at the beginning of the main file. You can adjust these to match your brand guidelines.
- Fonts: The template uses standard LaTeX fonts. You can modify these by adding font packages.
- Layout: Page margins and spacing can be adjusted in the `\geometry` settings.
- Table of Contents: Formatting of the TOC can be adjusted using the `tocloft` package settings.

### Adding Diagrams and Figures

The `voicenotion_diagrams.tex` file contains TikZ code for various diagrams. You can:

1. Modify existing diagrams to reflect your actual architecture and workflows.
2. Add new diagrams using the same styling for consistency.
3. Import the diagrams into the main document where appropriate.

## Tips for Creating Professional Documentation

1. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent formatting throughout the document.
2. **Structure**: Follow the detailed table of contents to ensure comprehensive coverage.
3. **Diagrams**: Use high-quality diagrams to illustrate complex concepts.
4. **Code Examples**: Include relevant code examples with proper syntax highlighting.
5. **Cross-References**: Use LaTeX's cross-referencing capabilities to make navigation easier.
6. **Review**: Have others review your document for clarity and correctness.
