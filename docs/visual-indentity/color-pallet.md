The colors chosen for SayNote’s brand identity were carefully selected to evoke specific emotions and communicate the essence of our voice-first experience. The palette is composed of deep, modern blues and a light, airy accent tone — creating a visual identity that is both professional and calming.

IV.4.1. Primary Blue – #4385F6
This vibrant shade of blue represents clarity, trust, and intelligent design. It evokes the calmness of the sky and the reliability of modern digital tools. As a central element of SayNote’s identity, this blue symbolizes focus, productivity, and confidence — perfectly aligning with our goal of creating a distraction-free, voice-powered experience.

IV.4.2. Deep Blues – #1E6DE0, #0043A5, #002E72
These darker, layered blues complement the primary color by adding depth and contrast. They reflect the structured and clear nature of SayNote’s interface, reinforcing stability, precision, and a sense of calm control.

IV.4.3. Light Accent – #CFE3FF
This soft, pastel accent adds a touch of lightness and joy to the overall brand. It brings a refreshing, breathable quality to the interface while improving visual hierarchy and accessibility. It supports our tone of clarity and calm, offering balance against the stronger blues.

By combining these colors, SayNote presents a visually harmonious and emotionally aligned system that reflects our core values: clarity, confidence, inclusivity, and calm productivity. The palette is designed to resonate with a modern, mindful audience looking for a better way to think out loud.
