Typography – Latin Fonts
Sans-serif fonts are a key element of SayNote’s visual identity. Our choice to use sans-serif typefaces reflects our commitment to a modern, clean, and user-friendly aesthetic.

a) Title Typeface
Our main display font features a bold, geometric design that brings clarity and structure to headings and key messages. Its minimalist lines and balanced proportions make it ideal for titles, slogans, and emphasis areas where visual impact is essential.

b) Primary Typeface
Our main content typeface is friendly, approachable, and highly legible across all platforms. With its rounded shapes and smooth flow, it adds warmth and calm to the brand. This font ensures excellent readability even at small sizes, making it perfect for body text, UI elements, and extended content.

Together, these two typefaces create a harmonious balance between structure and softness, perfectly aligned with SayNote’s voice-first, clear, and lightly joyful identity.
