Poster
A poster is a visual communication tool designed to convey information or promote a specific message. Typically large in size, it is displayed in public spaces such as walls, billboards, or storefronts. Posters often combine text, images, and graphic elements to attract attention and communicate ideas effectively.

a) Design Concept
The poster’s design concept focused on grabbing attention, expressing the brand identity, and highlighting SayNote’s core features. The layout was carefully planned to ensure visual appeal and readability, using a blend of striking imagery, vibrant brand colors, and concise, impactful text. The final posters were designed in A3 format.

b) Versions
To address different use cases and audiences, we created two posters in English — each with a unique message focus. The first centers around SayNote’s voice-first productivity, while the second emphasizes clarity and flow powered by AI and design. Both versions maintain visual consistency while targeting varied viewer needs and contexts.

c) Content Development
The content was crafted to deliver a compelling message to viewers. Engaging headlines, concise value statements, and a clear call-to-action were included to encourage users to take action — such as downloading the app or visiting the website. The visuals and copy reflect the brand’s tone: calm, clear, supportive, and modern.
